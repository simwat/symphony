Documentation of pushing, cloning and branching using syzygy and github 

-> To share (Push) from syzygy to the remote repository (Github)
1. Go to terminal on syzygy (control panel -> new -> terminal)
2. Use ls to see which folder you're in (what it contains)
3. Use cd to go into a subfolder and cd .. to go back up a folder
4. Initialize a repository in that folder by command git init
5. Add files of that folder to the repository by command git add . (mind the space and period)
6. Good practice to use command git status to check what was added
7. Use command git commit -m 'book keeping message' as a type of pre-pushing action
8. Set up the connnection with your github repository by command git remote add origin 'your_github_folder_url'
  Example: https://username/folder
9. Use command git push -u origin master
10. Should be in your github folder
11. Note that you just have to initialize a repository in the one folder once (step 8)
  Example: If fatal error occurs stating 'remote origin already exists' then:
  1. Use command git remote remove origin, then continue from step 8
  OR
  2. Ignore error and continue from step 9

-> Order of commands (from above pushing to Github)
1. git init 
2. git add . 
3. git status
4. git commit -m 'book keeping message'
5. git remote add origin 'your_github_folder_url'
6. git push -u origin master


-> To push changes to a new branch on the remote repository (Github)
1. Go to the terminal and into the directory (folder) you what to push
2. Initialize a repository in that folder by command git init
3. Create a new branch by command git checkout -b feature_branch_name
  checkout command switches branches
  -b command creates new branch
