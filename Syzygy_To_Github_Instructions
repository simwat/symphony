Documentation of 1) pushing, 2) branching and 3) cloning using syzygy and github 

-> To share (Push) from syzygy to the remote repository (Github)
1. Go to terminal on syzygy (control panel -> new -> terminal)
2. Use ls to see which folder you're in (what it contains)
3. Use cd to go into a subfolder and cd .. to go back up a folder
4. Initialize a repository in that folder by command git init
5. Add files of that folder to the repository by command git add . (mind the space and period)
6. Good practice to use command git status to check what was added
7. Use command git commit -m 'book keeping message' as a type of pre-pushing action
8. Set up the connnection with your github repository by command git remote add origin 'your_github_folder_url'
  Example: https://username/folder
9. Use command git push -u origin master
10. Should be in your github folder
11. Note that you just have to initialize a repository in the one folder once (step 8)
  Example: If fatal error occurs stating 'remote origin already exists' then:
  1. Use command git remote remove origin, then continue from step 8
  OR
  2. Ignore error and continue from step 9

-> Order of commands (for above, pushing to Github)
1. git init 
2. git add . 
3. git status
4. git commit -m 'book keeping message'
5. git remote add origin 'your_github_folder_url'
6. git push -u origin master


-> To push changes to a new branch on the remote repository (Github)
1. Go to the terminal and into the directory that was set up earlier 
(with origin added - see step 8 of first set 
2. Initialize a repository in that folder by command git init (not really necessary but doesn't hurt)
3. Create a new branch by command git checkout -b feature_branch_name
  checkout command switches branches
  -b command creates new branch

  https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/push-a-new-local-branch-to-a-remote-git-repository-and-track-it-too/13222
4. Use commands git add . and git status to add the files of that directory to the new branch
5. Use command git commit -m 'message'
6. Use command git push -u origin feature_branch_name
7. Check the new branch on Github which should be there
8. If there are errors with having permissions to push: please read the 'Invite collaboratore' section
9. If there are errors with syzygy branch being 'behind' the github branch, try git pull
I believe the idea is to push from a folder that contains similar contents as the github folder

-> Invite collaborators
To give permission for others to push changes to your repository:
1. Go to the repository on Github
2. Click on Settings
3. On the left hand side click on Manage Access
4. Click on Invite Collaborator

-> To clone other people's repository to syzygy 
1. Go to terminal and into correct directory
2. git clone <url from github>

-> To clone ONLY specific folders in other repository
1. Go to terminal and into correct directory
2. Use command git init to intialize empty repository
3. Use command git remote add origin <url> to fetch all objects from remote repository 
without checking them out
4. Use command git config core.sparseCheckout true 
This allows us to use sparse checkout and select subdirectories
5. Use command echo "directory" >> . git.info.sparse-checkout
echo is an output function and here we select which directory we want to clone
repeat command for each separate directories. Mind the spaces.
6. Run the command git pull origin master
7. This knowledge sourced from this link 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/600079/how-do-i-clone-a-subdirectory-only-of-a-git-repository
Look for the entry starting with 'What you are trying to do is called a sparse checkout'

-> To find other people's code
1. Use their URL or search up their handle

#test_test_test
