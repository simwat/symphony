Instructions to search for past PL data and to plot it through terminal commands!

1) Open up Jupyter Notebooks on the desktop (Should also work in Syzygy but all the data files would have had to be uploaded)
2) Open a new terminal and go to the folder in which the Search_Spectra.py and Plot_Spectra.py reside (typically it would be in /Documents/PL-folder)
    use the commands cd and ls to navigate through to the right folder/directory
3) Type 'python Search_Spectra.py'
4) It will ask for the keyword/sample you are searching for: enter it in the terminal
5) Please wait until is prints out that it has finished search
6) Highlight with your mouse the filename you would like to plot and copy using a right click
7) Then type 'python Plot_Spectra.py'
8) It will ask for the filename for which you want it to plot
9) Right click and paste the previously selected name: press enter
10) A new window will be available on the control bar at the bottom of the screen: click on it
11) A plot will appear, with the PL in meV. You can hover over a spot to see the value at the cursor. You can also save the plot. 

There is it! Quick and elegant search and plot method!
